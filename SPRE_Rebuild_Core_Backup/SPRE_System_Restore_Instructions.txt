SPRE PLATFORM — SYSTEM RESTORE INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the following core ZIP files:
   - Combined_Coil1_Chip_Build.zip
   - SPRE_Master_File_Manifest.txt
   - SPRE_File_Integrity_Hash_List.txt

2. Verify file integrity:
   - Use any SHA-256 tool (e.g., sha256sum) to verify the hash of each file
   - Compare with SPRE_File_Integrity_Hash_List.txt

3. Restore folders:
   - Extract Coil_1/ and Quantum_Chip/ into the /SPRE/Hardware directory
   - Extract all .txt files into /SPRE/Docs/

4. Reboot system into SPRE control layer

5. Test basic integration:
   - Run phase-lock on Coil 1
   - Check signal output through Quantum Chip
   - Confirm AI learning response is active

6. Confirm subsystem status:
   - Open the Master File Manifest
   - Validate each file/component marked ✅ is present and active

7. Begin simulation routines
   - Re-run full system test
   - Begin Phase 3 development (Control Systems, AI Expansion, etc.)
