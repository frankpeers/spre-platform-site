SPRE WHITE PAPER: Self-Programmed Resonant Engine â€” Full System Overview

Abstract
The Self-Programmed Resonant Engine (SPRE) is a fully integrated, multi-layered platform combining quantum physics, AI evolution, field modulation, and real-time environmental feedback. This white paper details the function, architecture, and interdependent operations of the eight primary subsystems, the LYRA/ORION AI cores, and the harmonic-terrain interface. SPRE is designed to sense, learn from, and adapt to energetic and environmental conditions with coherence and intelligence.
